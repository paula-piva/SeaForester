                    Rising global temperatures are causing a decrease in the natural predator of the purple sea urchin which is causing the populations of the purple sea urchins to grow. An overabundance of purple sea urchins is severely threatening kelp forests in northern California. As a result, 95% of kelp forests have been decimated. Recent methods of removal by scuba divers or the reintegration of sea otters have proven to be unable to keep up with the overwhelming populations of the purple sea urchins. (NPR)<br><br>The Sea Forester is a submersible vessel with the purpose of reining in the population of the purple sea urchins to a sustainable level, in order to provide an opportunity for the kelp forests to regrow. The Sea Forester is able to autonomously move through the ocean using a GPS system and sensors to avoid impact with its surroundings. It scans the seafloor for purple sea urchins using a camera system that analyzes its feed for the purple sea urchins. Once detected, the Sea Forester removes them using mechanical arms and places the urchins into a collection chamber. Once the chamber is full, the Sea Forester returns to its docking port on the surface and empties the chamber. In order for maximum efficacy, multiple Sea Foresters work in tandem in alternating groups. This allows for continual removal of sea urchins while recharging of the vessels takes place. <br><br>The purple sea urchins collected would then be repurposed for compost or sold to individuals to be raised and sold for food.  The ultimate goal of this device would be to maintain an optimum population balance to ensure kelp forests can return to their former state without completely eradicating the purple sea urchin population.</p>

            <p>Morgan Murphy-Cannella is the Kelp Restoration Coordinator for the California division of ReefCheck. Reefcheck is an organization dedicated to the care and preservation of reef communities, and working towards kelp forest restoration. As Kelp Restoration Coordinator, it is Morgan’s responsibility to monitor the purple sea urchin populations and coordinate dives for their removal.<br><br> Due to cold temperatures and harsh conditions, the number of cold water divers are fewer compared to more tropical waters. In addition, the area affected and the sheer number of the purple sea urchin populations render removal a time consuming task for the divers coordinated by Morgan.<br><br>As a result, when Morgan became aware of the Sea Forester, she decided it would be effective in moderating the populations of the purple sea urchins and has begun successfuly implementing them into ReefCheck’s Kelp Restoration Program.</p>

The Noyo Center for Marine Science has formed a collaborative team on the North Coast to begin clearing the purple sea urchins from the Mendocino and Sonoma coasts by creating a kelp “refuge” area.<br><br>Crans holds the responsibility of obtaining certain technology that aid the Noyo Center for Marine Science’s many projects. While doing research on which technology would be most beneficial to the Help the Kelp initiative, Crans discovered that the Sea Forester was designed to help the very problem that they are trying to solve.<br><br>By using the Sea Forester to help clear the purple sea urchins from the Mendocino and Sonoma coasts, the kelp in the area will have a chance to grow and reproduce at a regular rate. The specimen collected by the Sea Forester may support the development of a commercial market for the purple sea urchins.</p>
