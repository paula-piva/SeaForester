                    Rising global temperatures are causing a decrease in the natural predator of the purple sea urchin which is causing the populations of the purple sea urchins to grow. An overabundance of purple sea urchins is severely threatening kelp forests in northern California. As a result, 95% of kelp forests have been decimated. Recent methods of removal by scuba divers or the reintegration of sea otters have proven to be unable to keep up with the overwhelming populations of the purple sea urchins. (NPR)<br><br>The Sea Forester is a submersible vessel with the purpose of reining in the population of the purple sea urchins to a sustainable level, in order to provide an opportunity for the kelp forests to regrow. The Sea Forester is able to autonomously move through the ocean using a GPS system and sensors to avoid impact with its surroundings. It scans the seafloor for purple sea urchins using a camera system that analyzes its feed for the purple sea urchins. Once detected, the Sea Forester removes them using mechanical arms and places the urchins into a collection chamber. Once the chamber is full, the Sea Forester returns to its docking port on the surface and empties the chamber. In order for maximum efficacy, multiple Sea Foresters work in tandem in alternating groups. This allows for continual removal of sea urchins while recharging of the vessels takes place. <br><br>The purple sea urchins collected would then be repurposed for compost or sold to individuals to be raised and sold for food.  The ultimate goal of this device would be to maintain an optimum population balance to ensure kelp forests can return to their former state without completely eradicating the purple sea urchin population.</p>
